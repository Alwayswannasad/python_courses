        "5": "No. Then the game would have support for resolutions. Then you can play Yakuza 7 in 1440@60 without worrying about how it looks on 1440p monitor and even you can play 4k@30 on the same monitor if your 1440p monitor can accept 4K signal.\n\nFor 4K monitors performance modes will still be a problem due to the fact that those modes will almost always never run on 4K except less demanding games. You'll have to rely on whatever upscaling technique the devs are implementing.\n\nSo if Sony adds a native 1440p support on PS5, a 1440p 144/165/240hz. monitor is be the best choice for both IQ and performance (you'll be able to access 1440@120 performance modes in games like Destiny 2 easily) and it'll be a beast PC display too.",
        "6": "No no, it's for PS5, Rainbow Six Siege especially. The problem in Siege is, there is lean left/right on the L3/R3 buttons so crouch on R3 isn't really an option because leaning is *really really* important. But you want to be able to crouch and aim around at the same time so I have the circle button (crouch) on one paddle and the X button ( jump button) on the other. This way I don't have to take my thumb off the stick while in a gunfight. It's useful in other games as well like riding my horse in Rdr2 - I can mash the X button on my horse (riding faster) and aim at the baddies at the same time or just look around freely.... Or browse reddit while galloping in a general direction, lol.\n\nThe original Circle and X buttons remain untouched and can be used without a problem, too. It's just a duplication.",
